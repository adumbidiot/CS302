Using C++ object oriented programming methods, create a singly linked list.

The singly linked list is a chain of its item.
Each item contains two parts—data and pointer.
The data part is to store information and the pointer part of an item is used to point or to store the address of the next item.
You are asked to build a singly linked list that has two pointers—one(pfirst) points to the first item of the list and another one(plast) points to the last item of the list.
The program should also provide a menu of choices that the user can use to do basic operations on the linked list such as a) adding a new item, b) delete an item, c) show the number of items, d) show all items, or simply to exit.
